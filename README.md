## Golang nanomsg bindings

Package nanomsg adds language bindings for nanomsg in Go. nanomsg is a
high-performance implementation of several "scalability protocols". See
http://nanomsg.org/ for more information.

This is a work in progress. nanomsg is still in a beta stage. Expect its
API, or this binding, to change.

## Installing

### Install nanomsg lib

First, make sure you have the nanomsg library installed. You can either [download and install from source](http://nanomsg.org/download.html), or try your favorite package manager:

    # using brew in osx 
    brew install nanomsg


### Using *go get*

    $ go get github.com/op/go-nanomsg

After this command *go-nanomsg* is ready to use. Its source will be in:

    $GOROOT/src/pkg/github.com/op/go-nanomsg

You can use `go get -u -a` to update all installed packages.
